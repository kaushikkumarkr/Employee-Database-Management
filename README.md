# Employee-Database-Management

The "Employee Database Management" project represents a collaborative effort undertaken by my team and me. In this project, we have developed a comprehensive employee database system with a Python-based frontend. The primary objective of this system is to facilitate the efficient addition and storage of employee details, enabling advanced filtering based on specific criteria and requirements. This robust database management solution serves as a valuable tool for organizations seeking to effectively store and manage their employee data.
